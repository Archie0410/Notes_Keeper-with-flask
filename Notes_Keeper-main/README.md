## Challenges Faced & Solutions

- **Managing state efficiently**: Solved by using React hooks like `useState` to track notes and inputs.
- **Component reusability**: Broke down the app into smaller components, passing data via props for better maintainability.
- **Responsive design**: Ensured mobile-friendly layout using CSS flexbox/grid and media queries.
- **Deployment issues**: Learned about build commands and publish directories for React apps on Vercel and Netlify through documentation and tutorials.
